# multi-agent-web-ai
A multi-agent AI system designed to autonomously navigate the web, collect and process information, cross-verify data from multiple sources, and produce structured, reliable insights through reasoning.
# 🚀 Multi-Agent Web AI

> An autonomous multi-agent system that browses the web, extracts relevant information, verifies data across multiple sources, and generates structured insights using reasoning.

---

## 📌 Overview

`multi-agent-web-ai` is designed to simulate intelligent research behavior by combining multiple AI agents that collaborate to:

- Navigate websites autonomously  
- Extract meaningful data  
- Cross-check information across sources  
- Reason over collected data  
- Generate structured, reliable insights  

Instead of manually browsing and verifying information, this system automates the entire workflow.

## 🧠 Architecture

The system follows a **multi-agent design**, where each agent performs a specialized role:

### 🤖 Agents

- **Crawler Agent**  
  Navigates and retrieves web content  

- **Extraction Agent**  
  Cleans and structures raw data  

- **Verification Agent**
